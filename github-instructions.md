### Basic Github instructions

First, check out [the Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) written by
Scott Chacon and Ben Straub.  The entire book is online and a great reference
for both new git users trying to learn the ropes and command line wizards
trying to automate their coffee pots based on the number of frustrated git
commits per hour.

If you are completely new to git, skim the first three chapters of Pro Git
and check out [the git tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial).  The 
tutorial is fast paced to refer back to the Pro Git book as necessary.

Finally, don't be shy!  Myself and others might have a simple fix for any
conflicts you create while working on this hackathon.  Use the slack help
channel, feel free to Direct message myself and others using the @User
